                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a sophomore at <a href="https://uwlax.edu"> University of Wisconsin-La Crosse </a>. I went to highschool at <a href = https://nbexcellence.org> New Berlin West</a>.
                    During highschool, I played volleyball and played in the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra (MYSO). Throughout highschool, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to take multiple computer science courses.
                    These courses helped me realize that computer science is something I enjoy and want to make a career out of in the future.
