                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a sophomore at <a href="https://uwlax.edu"> University of Wisconsin-La Crosse </a>. I went to highschool at <a href = https://nbexcellence.org> New Berlin West</a>.
                    During highschool, I played volleyball and played in the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra (MYSO). Throughout highschool, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to take multiple computer science courses.
                    These courses helped me realize that computer science is something I enjoy and want to make a career out of in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My major is computer science and my minor is Mathematics. In addition to my academics here at UWL, I also play volleyball for the men's club team and am the current treasurer of the club. 
                    I am studying computer science with hopes of getting a career in data science or software engineering.

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p> 
                    In the future I plan on pursuing a career in software engineering or data science. I am planning on taking more math courses in the future to prepare myself for data science. I also
                    plan on potientally pursuing a masters degree in either data science, software engineering, or computer science at UW-Madison.
